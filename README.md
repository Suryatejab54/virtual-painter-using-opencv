🎨 Virtual Painter Using OpenCV and Hand Tracking
This interactive Python project transforms your webcam into a gesture-controlled drawing board. No touchscreen or stylus needed—just your fingers! Powered by OpenCV and a custom hand tracking module, this app detects hand gestures in real-time to switch tools, draw, and erase on a virtual canvas.

🛠 Features:

✋ Hand Gesture Control: Use two fingers to toggle between brush and selection modes; one finger to draw.


🎨 Color Selection: Select red, green, purple, or black (eraser) by waving near virtual buttons.


🖌️ Smooth Drawing: Draw fluid strokes on a transparent canvas, with adjustable brush and eraser thickness.


📸 Canvas Blending: Overlays your art directly onto the webcam feed using masking and bitwise ops.


💾 Expandable: Add more gestures, tools, or even save your art with just a keystroke!
